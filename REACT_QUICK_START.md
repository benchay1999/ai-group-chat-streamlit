# React Frontend - Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with the new React-based matching room system for Group Chat.

## Overview

The React frontend provides a modern, real-time interface for the Group Chat game with these key features:

- **Browse Rooms**: View all available game rooms in a beautiful grid layout
- **Create Rooms**: Configure custom rooms with AI and human player counts
- **Join Rooms**: Join any available room with auto-assigned player numbers
- **Real-time Gameplay**: WebSocket-powered chat, voting, and game updates
- **Modern UI**: Gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, and responsive design

## Getting Started

### 1. Start the Backend

First, make sure the backend server is running:

```bash
# From the project root
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### 2. Configure the Frontend

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
echo "VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if not done)

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the React App

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start at `http://localhost:5173`.

Open your browser and navigate to this URL.

## Testing Locally

### Single Player (with AI)

2. Join the room
3. Game starts immediately with 4 AI players
4. Play against the AI

### Multiple Players

1. **Player 1**: Create a room with Max Humans = 2, Total Players = 5
2. **Player 2**: Open a new browser window/tab (or incognito mode)
3. **Player 2**: Join the room from the lobby
4. Game starts automatically with 3 AI players

### Testing on Same Computer

Use multiple browser windows or tabs:
- Regular window + Incognito window
- Chrome + Firefox
- Different browser profiles

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter**: Send message (when typing)
- **Shift + Enter**: Not supported (single-line input)

## Troubleshooting

### "Server Offline" in Lobby

**Problem**: Red dot showing "Server Offline"

**Solution**:
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
2. Verify `.env` has correct URL
3. Check terminal for backend errors

### WebSocket "Disconnected"

**Problem**: Connection status shows red "Disconnected"

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
3. Verify backend is running
4. Check firewall/antivirus blocking WebSocket connections

### Room Not Appearing in Lobby

**Problem**: Created room doesn't show up

**Solution**:
1. Click "Refresh" button
2. Wait 5 seconds for auto-refresh
3. Check room wasn't immediately filled (status changed to 'in_progress')

### Can't Send Messages

**Problem**: Message input is disabled

**Solution**:
- Check you're in Discussion phase (not Voting)
- Verify WebSocket is connected (green dot in header)
- Try refreshing the page

### Game Didn't Start

**Problem**: Stuck on waiting page even though room is full

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all players actually joined (check player list)
3. Wait 2 seconds for polling to detect status change
4. Try leaving and rejoining

## Advanced Configuration

### Change Backend URL for Production

Edit `.env`:
```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-production-backend.com
```

Rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Modify Room Settings

Edit `frontend/src/components/CreateRoomModal.jsx`:

```jsx
const [maxHumans, setMaxHumans] = useState(2);  // Change default
const [totalPlayers, setTotalPlayers] = useState(8);  // Change default
```

### Adjust Polling Interval

Edit `frontend/src/hooks/useRoomPolling.js`:

```js
const DEFAULT_INTERVAL = 1000; // Change from 2000 to 1000 (1 second)
```

```

## Comparison with Streamlit Frontend

| Feature | React | Streamlit |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Speed** | Fast, instant updates | Slower, polling-based |
| **UI** | Modern, gradient design | Simple, functional |
| **Real-time** | WebSocket native | WebSocket bridge via JS |
| **Mobile** | Fully responsive | Desktop-optimized |
| **Development** | JavaScript/React | Python only |
| **Deployment** | Static hosting (Vercel) | Streamlit Cloud |

## Next Steps

1. **Play a game**: Create a room and test all features
2. **Invite friends**: Share room codes to play together
3. **Customize**: Modify colors, layouts, or features
4. **Deploy**: Host on Vercel, Netlify, or your own server

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Check backend terminal for errors
3. Review network tab (F12 â†’ Network)
4. Verify all services are running

For WebSocket issues, look for:
- Red WebSocket errors in console
- Failed WS connection attempts
- CORS errors

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this with the Streamlit frontend simultaneously?**
A: Yes! Both frontends connect to the same backend and can coexist.

**Q: Do I need to stop the Streamlit app?**
A: No, they run on different ports (React: 5173, Streamlit: 8501)

**Q: Can players using React play with players using Streamlit?**
A: Yes, as long as they're in the same room, they can see each other's messages and votes.

**Q: How do I deploy this to production?**
A: See `frontend/README.md` for deployment guides (Vercel, Netlify, Docker).

**Q: Can I change the player number format?**
A: The backend assigns numbers automatically. You can modify the backend logic in `main.py` if needed.

Enjoy playing Group Chat with the new React frontend! ðŸŽ®
