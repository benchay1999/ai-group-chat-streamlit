# UI Fixes - Real-time Updates & Voting Results

## Overview

Fixed two UI issues in the matching room system:
1. AI player count now updates in real-time as sliders change
2. Voting summary and result now displayed in sidebar after voting completes

---

## Fix #1: Real-time AI Player Count

### Problem
When creating a room, the "🤖 AI Players: X" display stayed at 4 and didn't update when adjusting the sliders for human players and total players.

### Root Cause
The sliders were inside a Streamlit `form`, which only updates values when the form is submitted, not in real-time.

### Solution
Removed the form wrapper and used regular sliders with unique keys, allowing real-time updates as users drag the sliders.

### Changes Made

**Before:**
```python
with st.form("create_room_form"):
    max_humans = st.slider("Number of Human Players", ...)
    total_players = st.slider("Total Players", ...)
    st.info(f"🤖 AI Players: {total_players - max_humans}")
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Create & Join")
```

**After:**
```python
# Sliders outside form for real-time updates
max_humans = st.slider("Number of Human Players", ..., key="create_max_humans")
total_players = st.slider("Total Players", ..., key="create_total_players")

# This updates in real-time as sliders change
ai_count = total_players - max_humans
st.info(f"🤖 AI Players: {ai_count}")

submitted = st.button("Create & Join", key="create_submit")
```

### Result
- ✅ AI count updates immediately as you drag sliders
- ✅ No form submission needed to see changes
- ✅ Better user experience

### Example Behavior
```
Humans: 1, Total: 5
🤖 AI Players: 4

[User drags Humans to 2]
Humans: 2, Total: 5
🤖 AI Players: 3  ← Updates instantly

[User drags Total to 8]
Humans: 2, Total: 8
🤖 AI Players: 6  ← Updates instantly
```

## Fix #2: Voting Result Display

### Problem
The sidebar showed vote summary during voting but didn't show the final result (who was selected, their role, and who won) after voting completed.

### Root Cause
The voting summary section only displayed vote counts but didn't check for or display game outcome information.

### Solution
Enhanced the voting summary section to display full voting results when the game is in `game_over` phase.

### Changes Made

**Before:**
```python
if phase_l in ['voting', 'game_over', 'gameover']:
    if display_votes:
        st.sidebar.subheader("🗳️ Vote Summary")
        # Show votes and counts
        for voter, target in display_votes.items():
            st.sidebar.write(f"{voter} → {target}")
        # Show totals
        for target, cnt in sorted(counts.items(), ...):
            st.sidebar.write(f"{target}: {cnt}")
```

**After:**
```python
if phase_l in ['voting', 'game_over', 'gameover']:
    if display_votes:
        st.sidebar.subheader("🗳️ Vote Summary")
        # Show votes and counts
        for voter, target in display_votes.items():
            st.sidebar.write(f"{voter} → {target}")
        for target, cnt in sorted(counts.items(), ...):
            st.sidebar.write(f"{target}: {cnt}")
        
        # NEW: Show voting result after game is over
        if phase_l in ['game_over', 'gameover']:
            selected_suspect = game_state.get('selected_suspect')
            suspect_role = game_state.get('suspect_role')
            winner = game_state.get('winner')
            
            if selected_suspect:
                st.sidebar.divider()
                st.sidebar.subheader("📊 Voting Result")
                
                # Show who was selected
                if suspect_role == 'ai':
                    st.sidebar.success(f"✅ Selected: **{selected_suspect}** (AI)")
                    st.sidebar.success("🎉 Humans Win!")
                else:
                    st.sidebar.error(f"❌ Selected: **{selected_suspect}** (Human)")
                    st.sidebar.error("🤖 AI Wins!")
                
                # Show winner
                if winner:
                    st.sidebar.markdown(f"**Winner:** {winner.upper()}")
```

### Result
After voting completes, the sidebar shows:

**During Voting:**
```

## Technical Details

### Streamlit Form vs Regular Widgets

**Form-based (Old):**
- Values only update on form submission
- All inputs batched together
- Good for complex forms with many fields
- Bad for real-time feedback

**Regular Widgets (New):**
- Values update immediately on interaction
- Each widget independent
- Good for interactive controls
- Better for sliders that need live updates

### State Management

The voting result uses data from the game state:
```python
selected_suspect = game_state.get('selected_suspect')  # Who was voted out
suspect_role = game_state.get('suspect_role')          # 'ai' or 'human'
winner = game_state.get('winner')                       # 'human' or 'ai'
```

These values are set by the backend when voting completes.
