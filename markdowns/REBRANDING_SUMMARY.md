- Game header: "Group Chat"

## Testing

✅ No linting errors
✅ All references updated in React app
✅ Package name updated for consistency

## What Was NOT Changed

The following were intentionally left unchanged as they are separate implementations or backend components:

- Backend code (game logic, API endpoints)
- Streamlit frontend
- Discord bot implementation
- Other documentation files (general README, system architecture, etc.)

## How to Verify

1. Start the React frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`

3. Check:
   - ✅ Browser tab shows "Group Chat"
   - ✅ Lobby page shows "Group Chat" header
   - ✅ Game page shows "Group Chat" header

## Notes

The rebranding is **frontend-only** and does not affect:
- Backend functionality
- API endpoints
- Game mechanics
- Database/storage
- Other frontends (Streamlit, Discord)

The game is now consistently branded as "Group Chat" throughout the React user interface.
