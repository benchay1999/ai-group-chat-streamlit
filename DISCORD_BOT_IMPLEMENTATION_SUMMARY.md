```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Discord Bot Tokens**:
   - 1 coordinator bot token
   - 4-8 AI agent bot tokens
3. **OpenAI API Key**

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Discord Developer Portal

Create bots in [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

For **each** bot (coordinator + AI agents):
1. Create new application
2. Add bot
3. Enable intents:
   - ✅ Server Members Intent
   - ✅ Message Content Intent
4. Copy bot token
5. Invite to server with permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Embed Links
   - Use Slash Commands
   - Read Message History

#### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /home/wschay/ai-group-chat-streamlit

# Copy example env file
cp discord_bot/env.example .env

# Edit with your tokens
nano .env
```

Add your tokens:
```bash
DISCORD_MAIN_BOT_TOKEN=your_coordinator_token
DISCORD_AI_BOT_TOKEN_1=your_ai_bot_1_token
DISCORD_AI_BOT_TOKEN_2=your_ai_bot_2_token
DISCORD_AI_BOT_TOKEN_3=your_ai_bot_3_token
DISCORD_AI_BOT_TOKEN_4=your_ai_bot_4_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd discord_bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r ../backend/requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Run the Bot

```bash
# Option A: Using start script
./start.sh

# Option B: Direct Python
python main.py
```

## 🎮 How to Play

### In Discord

1. **Open Lobby**: `/lobby`
2. **Create Room**: Click "Create Room" or use `/create max_humans:2 total_players:6`
3. **Join Room**: Click "Join Room" or use `/join room_code:ABC123`
4. **Wait**: Room fills up with other players
5. **Discuss**: Chat naturally with other players (3 minutes)
6. **Vote**: Receive DM with voting form, select player to eliminate
7. **Results**: See who was eliminated and their role
8. **Repeat**: Continue until humans win (survive 3 rounds) or AI wins (eliminate all humans)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Game Settings (Environment Variables)

```bash
NUM_AI_PLAYERS=4           # Number of AI players
AI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini  # OpenAI model
DISCUSSION_TIME=180        # Discussion duration (seconds)
VOTING_TIME=60             # Voting duration (seconds)
