# Quick Test Guide - Matching Room System

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd /home/wschay/group-chat
conda activate group-chat
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Keep this terminal open. You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Step 2: Start Streamlit (New Terminal)
```bash
cd /home/wschay/group-chat
conda activate group-chat
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Browser should auto-open to `http://localhost:8501`

### Step 3: Create Your First Room

You'll see a dark cyberpunk-themed lobby with:
- Big "ðŸŽ® Human Hunter - Find Your Match" title
- "Create New Room" button

Click **"Create New Room"** and fill in:
- **Your Name**: "TestPlayer"
- **Room Name**: "My First Room" (or leave blank)
- **Number of Human Players**: 1
- **Total Players**: 5

Click **"Create & Join"** 

âœ… **Expected Result**: Game starts immediately since you're the only human needed!

## Test 2: Multi-Player Room (Requires 2 Browser Windows)

### Browser Window 1

1. Click "Leave Room" to return to lobby
2. Click "Create New Room"
3. Fill in:
   - **Your Name**: "Player1"
   - **Room Name**: "2 Player Test"
   - **Number of Human Players**: 2
   - **Total Players**: 5
4. Click "Create & Join"

âœ… **Expected**: You see a waiting screen showing "1/2" players

### Browser Window 2 (Incognito/Different Browser)

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
2. You should see the lobby with your room listed
3. Find the "2 Player Test" room card showing:
   ```
   ðŸŽ¯ 2 Player Test
   ðŸŸ¢ Waiting...
   ðŸ‘¥ Players: 1/2 humans
   ðŸ¤– Total Slots: 5
   ```
4. Click "Join Room"
5. Enter name: "Player2"
6. Click "Join Game"

âœ… **Expected**: Both windows automatically transition to game with:
- Player1 and Player2 (humans)
- Player 1, Player 2, Player 3 (AI agents)
- Total: 5 players

## Test 3: Room Browsing

Create multiple rooms with different settings to test the lobby:

### Create Room 1
- Name: "Quick Match"
- Humans: 1
- Total: 3
- **Result**: Click "Create & Join", game starts immediately

### Create Room 2
- Leave game, return to lobby
- Name: "Squad Up"
- Humans: 3
- Total: 6
- **Result**: Waiting screen

### Create Room 3 (New Browser)
- Name: "Duo Party"
- Humans: 2
- Total: 5
- **Result**: Waiting screen

Now your lobby should show both waiting rooms. Test:
- âœ… Both rooms visible
- âœ… Player counts accurate
- âœ… Status badges showing
- âœ… Join button works

## Test 4: Room Full Scenario

- Name: "Full Test"
- Humans: 2
- Total: 4
- You're at waiting screen (1/2)

### Browser 2: Join Room
- Join "Full Test" room
- Enter name
- âœ… Both transition to game
- âœ… Room disappears from lobby

### Browser 3: Try to Join

## API Testing (Optional)

Test the backend directly:

### Create Room
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/rooms/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "creator_id": "APITest",
    "room_name": "API Room",
    "max_humans": 2,
    "total_players": 5
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "room_code": "AB12CD",
  "room_name": "API Room",
  "max_humans": 2,
  "total_players": 5
}
```

### List Rooms
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rooms/list?page=0&per_page=10
```

### Get Room Info
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rooms/{ROOM_CODE}/info
```

Replace `{ROOM_CODE}` with actual code from create response.

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Server Offline"
**Solution**: Start backend first (`uvicorn main:app --reload`)

### Issue: Room not appearing
**Solution**: Only 'waiting' rooms show. In-progress rooms are hidden.

### Issue: Can't join room
**Possible causes**:
- Room already full
- Room already started
- Room code incorrect

### Issue: Waiting screen stuck
**Solution**: 
- Wait 2 seconds for next poll
- Check backend logs
- Verify backend is running

### Issue: Visual glitches
**Solution**: 
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear Streamlit cache
- Check browser console for errors

## Success Criteria

Your implementation is working correctly if:

1. âœ… Can create rooms with custom settings
2. âœ… Rooms appear in lobby list
3. âœ… Can join rooms from lobby
4. âœ… Waiting screen shows correct count
5. âœ… Game auto-starts when full
6. âœ… Multiple players can join same room
7. âœ… UI looks polished with cyberpunk theme
8. âœ… Page navigation works smoothly
9. âœ… Leave room returns to lobby
10. âœ… Existing game features unchanged

## Next Steps

Once basic testing is complete:

1. **Stress Test**: Create 15+ rooms to test pagination
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple players join simultaneously
3. **Edge Cases**: Try invalid inputs, extreme values
4. **Mobile Testing**: Test on mobile browsers
5. **Multi-Device**: Test on different screen sizes
