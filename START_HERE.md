## 🔧 Configuration

All settings can be customized when creating a room:

- **Human Players**: 1-4 (slider)
- **Total Players**: Human count to 12 (slider)
- **AI Players**: Auto-calculated (Total - Humans)

Default: 1 human, 5 total players (4 AI)

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Single Player

- Game starts immediately when you create

### For Multiplayer
- Set "Human Players" to desired count (2-4)
- Share room code with friends
- Everyone waits on waiting screen
- Game auto-starts when full

### Room Names
- Leave blank for auto-generation (e.g., "Room AB12CD")
- Or enter custom name (e.g., "Squad Night")

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Server Offline" Error
Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Room Not Visible

- In-progress rooms are hidden
- Try refreshing the page

### Can't Join Room
- Check if room is full
- Verify room hasn't started already
- Check backend logs for errors

### Waiting Screen Stuck
- Polls every 2 seconds (be patient)
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
- Check backend is running
